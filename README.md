# Divisional-Income-Statement-and-Stock-Analysis
This personal project explores financial data analysis and stock price modeling. It involves analyzing divisional income statements for two company divisions using the files diva-incstmt.csv and divb-incstmt.csv, creating visualizations to compare sales and expenses. The second part of the project uses Spotify's stock data (Spotify_Closing_Price.csv and DJIA_Closing_Price.csv) to calculate daily returns, test for normal distribution, identify extreme returns, and perform a regression with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). This project demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and statistical modeling within the FinTech space.
